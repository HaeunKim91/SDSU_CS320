				Assignment 1
				   CS 320

This is the first [mini-]assignment for CS320.  Each assignment will be mailed
to you, but I have also put a copy of this first one in your home directory.
Future assignments, such as assignment2, will [only] be sent to you via mail.
Directions for all assignments and programs can also be found under ~cs570
on edoras.

If you are new to UNIX, there are several tutorials at:
http://edoras.sdsu.edu/doc/unixtut/
The page
https://library.sdsu.edu/computers-technology/hosting/instructor-class-accounts#edoras-software
...has lots of useful information, including how to recover deleted files
using the 'goback' and 'recover' commands.

To access your mail on edoras, simply type
mail
...and you will get a list of messages, which you can read one at a time.  Or:
mail carroll
...will allow you to compose a mail message to me.

http://edoras.sdsu.edu/software/ contains quite a bit of software that
may be of use to you (and a lot of it is not related to UNIX; for example,
SDSU students can download the McAfee VirusScan software for the horribly
insecure Microsoft Windows platform -- but you need a RedID to do this).

You may wish to peruse the 'Email' section on this page, for things that
might be better than clunky-old-mail (mailx).  The 'File Editors' section
lists various choices of editors, though I *STRONGLY* urge you to become
acquainted with vi (vim).  The xeroxed notes have a summary of most of the
commands, along with a 'cheat sheet' that shows the keyboard layout.

Unless you plan to do all your work from the labs on campus, you will need
software to allow you to work from home.  These can be found in the 'Internet'
section.  ssh and X-Win32 are discussed below, but your best bet is to get
the [free] home edition of MobaXterm from

https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html
e.g.,
https://download.mobatek.net/10520180106182002/MobaXterm_Installer_v10.5.zip

ssh gives you an 80x24 login window to edoras from within WinBlows via:
http://edoras.sdsu.edu/files/SSHSecureShellClient-3.2.9.exe
(If you are running a UNIX system, then you probably have ssh already, and
you can run any X application on edoras and display it remotely on your laptop.)
If you install ssh on Windows, your Start menu will have an ssh submenu
from which you can run either the Secure Shell Client or the Secure File
Transfer Client.  In either case, when making a connection, you'll have to
specify the host (edoras.sdsu.edu), the username (your personal cssc0nnn number),
and then it will ask for your password.  With the Secure File Transfer Client,
you'll be able to see all your edoras files and directories on your Windows
host, and you can move files between machines simply by dragging them from
one panel to the other.  [CAUTION: You may be tempted to use this facility
to edit your programs with a Windows editor and move the file to edoras.
I strongly recommend you learn to use the vim UNIX editor (which you can
also install for free on your Windows machine if you really like it), and
do your editing on edoras.  If you insist on moving source files, though, choose
Secure File Transfer Client --> Operation --> File Transfer Mode --> ASCII
...or else the edoras compilers may complain about inappropriate white space
in your source code.]

UNIX users (Mac and Linux people) don't have to install anything.  Just
launch a terminal window and give a command like
ssh cssc0nnn@edoras.sdsu.edu
or 
ssh edoras.sdsu.edu -l cssc0nnn
(The first time [only] that you do this, you'll have to answer "yes" to the
fingerprint/authenticity question.)

You can also run X from WinBlows, but you'll need your RedID and:
http://edoras.sdsu.edu/~download/xwin32.html
...though this will only be effective when you're on campus.
(If you have some spare disk space on your laptop/desktop, I recommend
skipping the xwin32 stuff, and instead making your machine a dual-boot
Linux/WinBlows machine (this allows you to use X even when you're off
campus).  You can do this for free, and get acquainted with something
professional instead of the horrid Microsoft stuff.  I recommend:
http://linuxmint.com/
...and when you're ready to abandon WinBlows completely, see me about installing
your games and other stuff that supposedly 'needs' a Microsoft platform to run).

Once you log in, you will see your standard prompt, which will look like:
edoras:cssc0nnn[1]%
[cssc0099@edoras ~]$
or
edoras ~[1]%
...depending on what shell you are using.  Your prompt will change as you work,
and the significance of that number in the prompt will be discussed later.

Your first task is to change your account password.  Do not choose
something obvious, or even a word in the dictionary, or your account
might be broken into.  Reasonable choices include sequences which
include a non-letter (but don't just put a digit on the end of a word,
as this is also easily guessed).  Enter
passwd
and then answer the questions - for security reasons, what you type will
not appear on the screen.

Second, experiment with the finger command by typing:
finger -m $user
to see your own information.  Compare this to mine:
finger -m carroll
Now use:
chfn
to update your finger entry.  You must place a proper entry in the Name field,
which must include your first and last name.  You can view your results with
finger cssc0nnn
...and verify that the 'In real life:' field contains your real name (type
the digits of your actual account number in place of the 'nnn' of course).
Note that you are not done interacting with chfn until you get the normal shell
prompt back; chfn will ask for additional information, such as phone numbers,
which you should leave blank.  (You can always run chfn again, if you mess
things up.)

Third, use the chsh command to ensure that tcsh is your login shell.  Type
chsh
...and then type
/bin/tcsh
...when it asks for your new shell.

Fourth, create a soft link to the course calendar file:
cd $HOME
ln -s ~cs320/calendar
Shell variables begin with '$', and lots of them are predefined.
'$HOME' is a string denoting your home directory (as is '~').
ln -s ~cs320/calendar
does the same thing as
ln -s ~cs320/calendar ./calendar
(That is, it creates a 'shortcut' with the same name in your current directory.)
If this command is successful, you can do
cat ~/calendar
...to see the contents of the /home/ma/cs320/calendar file, which will be
updated with due dates for our programs, assignments, and exams.  If a file
called 'calendar' is in your home directory, every day at midnight a UNIX
daemon will awaken, look at the dates in this file, and send you an email
containing all the lines that match today's date (as well as tomorrow's date).

Fifth, create and edit a ~/.forward file to redirect your email.  This should
be a two-line file containing something like:

\cssc0nnn,
yourmailname@gmail.com-or-wherever

Put your actual cssc-username on line 1, preceded by the backslash.
[This is VERY important -- you get an infinite loop of mail deliveries
otherwise! Make sure you use a backslash (\), NOT a forward slash (/) .]
On line 2, list your gmail or yahoo or whatever account you use most for mail.
To create this file, I recommend:
vi ~/.forward

Once you think you have it right, TEST your file by sending yourself some mail:

mail cssc0nnn
...and just send a little 'hi there' message.  You end your message with
a single period on an otherwise empty (last) line; ^D (Control-D) at the
start of a line can also be used to end the message.  Give the system a few
minutes to process your mail (EVERYTHING gets scanned for viruses and spam
content, so mail is not delivered instantaneously) and then check your mail
to see if it arrived (here in your edoras acccount, as well as the account
you listed on line 2).  This should be a TWO-line file (not 1, not 3).

The entire set of UNIX manuals is on-line, available through the 'man' command.
Lastly, type:
man finger
...to see the entry for finger.  To find useful information when you are not
sure of the command name, use apropos:
apropos printer
...will give you a list of man entries pertaining to the printer
(specifically, it displays those entries with the character sequence 'printer'
somewhere in the command summary line).

You will find a file called 'assignment1' in the home directory of your account;
it contains this text.
This file, and all the other ones relevant to this course, are publicly
available under the /home/ma/cs320 directory; some C-related files can
be found under ~masc0000, principally under the Week* directories.
Below ~masc0000/CbyDiscovery/ch*/ are the various .c files in the Foster text.

Summary of Assignment 1:
1. Change your password
2. Change your finger information
3. Change your shell to tcsh
4. Make a [soft] link to the calendar file
5. Create a ~/.forward file that sends your mail to two places
6. Send some mail to yourself
7. Experiment with the "finger", "man" and "apropos" commands
(Do these experiments in the cssc account that I have given you; if you do these
tasks elsewhere, I won't be able to ascertain if you have actually done them.
Make sure you don't just kill the ssh window you are using when you are through;
exit gracefully by typing 'logout' or 'exit' before shutting ssh down.)

The due date for this assignment (and all future assignments) can be found
in the file ~cs320/calendar on edoras.
